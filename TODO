*   Decouple the chunk_manager view fulcrum into a helper module
        chunk_manager has most_NESW__chunk_node's which is primarily
        used for the view fulcrum. This is beyond the responsibility
        of the chunk_manager. It should only be storing and managing
        chunks in memory.

        We will however need this fuctionality in every single backend
        implementation, so to remedy this, we will want to remove
        all utilization of chunk_manager for rendering chunks into
        a helper module called "viewing_fulcrum" placed in rendering.

        Nothing in core will make use of this, and only backend
        implementations will use it in PLATFORM_Gfx_Context.
