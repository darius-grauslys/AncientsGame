        (( ready to migrate, need ui_tool update. ))
        1) Remove all asset utilization in backend. For now just do SDL, and then
        do NDS afterwards. This is mainly in sdl_ui.h and sdl_gfx_window_manager.h
        as they use the grit ui_tile indices. Make PLATFORM_ functions to set
        UI_Tile_Maps of the PLATFORM_gfx_windows. On NDS this will just result in
        modifying the graphics memory directly.

        (( ready for modification ))
        2) f_tile_render_kernel(Chunk_Map_Node *p.., Local_Vec3);
           PLATFORM_render_tile(gfx_context, gfx_window, Camera p.., u16 tile_texture_index, Tile_Vec3);

            f_tile_render_kernel - gives core a kernel means to manipulate tile rendering
                for example: walls.
            PLATFORM_render_tile - puts a tile into a gfx window at the given position
                relative to the camera.
            
            This gives CORE an agnostic means to control tile rendering. Can also add:
            PLATFORM_render_voxel(...); at a future date.

        (( not ready. Finish (1) and (2) first. )
        3) Move all serialization to m_process functions. Implement a process blocking chain.

        4) Whenever possible, don't take Game as an argument and use helpers, instead take the
            actual hierarchy object as argument, and any other hierarchy arguments. Helpers should
            be left to the game-dev as they decide the Game_t composition.
