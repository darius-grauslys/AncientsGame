build           -   the output directory for building with make
core            -   platform independent game logic resides here
include         -   all core header files.
unix_opengl     -   implementation for unix opengl
nds             -   implementation for the nintendo DS

A few header files in core will not be implemented in core.
This is the comprehensive list:
    *   game.h
    *   multiplayer/multiplayer.h
    *   rendering/sprite.h
    *   rendering/tile.h
    *   world/chunk.h
    *   world/chunk_manager.h

-------

Building:
Only ever run make from the base directory.
So, if your current directory doesn't have the directory
"build" in it, do not run make.

For each platform, there are the given make targets:
make <platform name>
make test_<platform name>

Even if a platform doesn't have a test suite, it still has
a test_<platform name> just to inform the user that it
has no test suite.

The base directory Makefile is to expose build targets as
well as establishing some environment variables.

Always be sure to check the platform directory's README
before building.

-------

Contributing:
Whenever you make a contribution to the project, make sure
to test your contribution within unix_opengl/test/

-------

Testing:
All game logic testing will occur in unix_opengl.
All other platform directories will only have testing
for platform specific logic (as seen in the above list.)

unix_opengl should be considered as "the correct" implementation.
Meaning, if your platform implementation doesn't work but unix_opengl
does, then it's a you problem, not a game logic problem.

unix_opengl must have a test suite. All other platform directories
do not require a test suite, but should have one whenever possible.
For example, nds will not have a test suite (for now anyways.)
