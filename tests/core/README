This is where the tests for ./core can be found.
This is the most important testsuite for AncientsGame
as it tests all the buisness logic.

I might come around to making tests for the specific
PLATFORMS as well, but for now, I wont. Maybe you'd like to?

I have to give credit to mikelong on StackOverflow for the idea
of including the C source file into the test module.
