--- HOW TO PORT ---
Create a backend definition for everything you
see in platform.h

For struct, and macro definitions, put it in a platform_defines.h
located at the base level of your include folder.

You can put the function definitions for functions in platform.h
where ever you want. (hint: be organized about it.)
