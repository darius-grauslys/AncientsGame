In core source and header files, if you see:

    PLATFORM_

in header files:
    This is a declaration without a definition
    within the context of ./core .

    The definition resides in a backend implementation.
    that being unix_opengl, or nds.

in source files:
    invocation to a platform defined signature.

NOTE:
    unix_opengl does not compile at the moment.
    I wont be working on this until after
    the next push to master.
