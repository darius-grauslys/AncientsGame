    
        
            Alright so what would be nice is to move the engine to /opt/lavender
            Here we will have core, backends, and tools.

            The engine will have a CLI tool "./lavender"

                lavender new Bubbles_Game

            This will make Bubbles_Game directory, copy the base directory Makefile
            and produce the following:
            ./bubbles_game
            |_ include
            |_ source
            |_ Makefile.build
            |_ Makefile.include
            ./profile
            |_ Makefile.profile

                lavender build

            this will build the game with all platforms in Makefile.profile.
            By default this is just SDL.

                lavender run

            this will run the build, only works if there is only one platform.
            If there are multiple the user must specify

                lavender run --platform sdl

            default launchers are found in Makefile.profile

                run_sdl:
                    ./build/sdl/${GAME_EXECUTABLE}

                run_nds:
                    melonDS ./build/nds/${GAME_EXECUTABLE}.nds

            ..

                lavender tool ui_builder

            tool sub-command runs tools from ./tools

            Eventually, will be nice to have:

                lavender-gui

            which will be the GUI editor of the engine!
